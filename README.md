# Scalable Player Analytics Platform for Game Telemetry

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a scalable, real-time analytics platform for processing game telemetry data using AWS services. It's designed to handle millions of events per day from multiple games, providing real-time insights and historical analysis capabilities.


### Key Components:
1. **Data Ingestion Layer**
   - AWS Kinesis Data Streams for real-time event ingestion
   - AWS API Gateway for REST API endpoints
   - Lambda functions for data validation and processing

2. **Processing Layer**
   - AWS Kinesis Data Analytics for real-time analytics
   - AWS Lambda for event processing and transformations
   - Amazon EMR for batch processing

3. **Storage Layer**
   - Amazon S3 for raw data storage (Data Lake)
   - Amazon Redshift for data warehousing
   - Amazon DynamoDB for real-time leaderboards and player stats

4. **Analytics Layer**
   - Amazon QuickSight for visualization
   - Custom API endpoints for real-time metrics
   - Scheduled reports using AWS Lambda

## Features
- Real-time player behavior analytics
- Session tracking and analysis
- Player retention metrics
- In-game economy analysis
- Performance metrics tracking
- Automated reporting and alerting

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.9+
- AWS SDK (Boto3)
- FastAPI for API development
- Apache Spark for batch processing
- Docker for containerization
- Terraform for infrastructure as code

## Security Notice
⚠️ Before deploying:
1. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` (never commit `.env` files)
2. Use AWS IAM best practices - create a dedicated IAM user with minimal permissions
3. Enable AWS CloudTrail for audit logging
4. Review and customize security group rules
5. Enable encryption at rest for all data stores
6. Regularly rotate access keys and review permissions

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your secure credentials
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Configure AWS credentials using AWS CLI or environment variables
5. Deploy infrastructure: `cd infrastructure && terraform init && terraform apply`
6. Start the API: `uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload`

## Local Development
1. Install Docker and Docker Compose
2. Set up your environment variables (see Security Notice)
3. Run `docker-compose up` to start local development environment
4. Access the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## Testing
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Deployment
The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Each push to main triggers:
1. Unit tests
2. Integration tests
3. Infrastructure validation
4. Automated deployment to AWS

⚠️ Note: Configure GitHub Secrets for CI/CD pipeline:
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- AWS_REGION
- Other environment-specific variables

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- CloudWatch Dashboards for monitoring
- Automated alerts for system health
- Regular data quality checks
- Performance optimization recommendations
