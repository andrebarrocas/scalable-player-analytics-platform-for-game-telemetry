# Scalable Player Analytics Platform for Game Telemetry

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a scalable, real-time analytics platform for processing game telemetry data using AWS services. It's designed to handle millions of events per day from multiple games, providing real-time insights and historical analysis capabilities.

## Architecture

### Key Components:
1. **Data Ingestion Layer**
   - AWS Kinesis Data Streams for real-time event ingestion
   - AWS API Gateway for REST API endpoints
   - Lambda functions for data validation and processing

2. **Processing Layer**
   - AWS Kinesis Data Analytics for real-time analytics
   - AWS Lambda for event processing and transformations
   - Amazon EMR for batch processing

3. **Storage Layer**
   - Amazon S3 for raw data storage (Data Lake)
   - Amazon Redshift for data warehousing
   - Amazon DynamoDB for real-time leaderboards and player stats

4. **Analytics Layer**
   - Amazon QuickSight for visualization
   - Custom API endpoints for real-time metrics
   - Scheduled reports using AWS Lambda

## Features
- Real-time player behavior analytics
- Session tracking and analysis
- Player retention metrics
- In-game economy analysis
- Performance metrics tracking
- Automated reporting and alerting

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.9+
- AWS SDK (Boto3)
- FastAPI for API development
- Apache Spark for batch processing
- Docker for containerization
- Terraform for infrastructure as code

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure AWS credentials
4. Deploy infrastructure: `cd infrastructure && terraform init && terraform apply`
5. Start the API: `uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload`

## Local Development
1. Install Docker and Docker Compose
2. Run `docker-compose up` to start local development environment
3. Access the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## Testing
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Deployment
The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Each push to main triggers:
1. Unit tests
2. Integration tests
3. Infrastructure validation
4. Automated deployment to AWS

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- CloudWatch Dashboards for monitoring
- Automated alerts for system health
- Regular data quality checks
- Performance optimization recommendations
